        <p><i>Centric</i><br>
        Double Bass<br>
        ~ 19 mins</p>
        <p><i>Centric</i> was written in 2024 as part of my masters portfolio. it should last just shy of 20 minutes (ish) and is written for the double bass (solo).<br>
    it employs some experimental notations and extended techniques which are quite interesting .<br>
    if you play the double bass, and like making funny noises on it, please have a look :)

 <p><i>strrr4</i><br>
   String Quartet<br>
    Undetermined duration (perhaps 10-15 mins or indefinitely longer)</p>
    <p><i>strrr4 </i>is a string quartet which uses mobile form and indeterminate notations of a few kinds. The principle idea behind the composition came from thinking about the progression of serialism, its structures, and their uses through the 20th Century as composers used it increasingly totalitarianly in terms of their generation and treatment of musical materials. (thinking about total and post-serial composers employing these ideas: Messiaen's mode de valeurs...; Boulez' or later Ferneyhough's chord permutations and multiplications; Takemitsu's more indulgent yet strictly structured manupulations of harmonic material.)<br>
    Anyway, in <i>strrr4</i> I took this whole idea of intricate numerical structures a layer deeper - beyond the treatment of musical parameters and into the digital structures of the files displaying the score on screen. <br>
    It was basically a very long datamoshing process to corrupt the file containing the composition (in various formats), <b>thus</b>, creating some interesting graphic/indeterminate features in the notation. <br>
    I can explain more to you about the process and how it came to be this mobile form if you are interested but won't jam up this page any more with waffle.<br>
    Watch a digital realisation of this work over on my <a href="av.html">a/v</a> page.
