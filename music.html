        <p>this is <i>Centric</i><br>
        it was written in 2024 for my masters. it should last just shy of 20 minutes (ish) and is for the solo double bass.<br>
    it uses some experimental notations and extended techniques which are quite interesting.<br>
    if you play the double bass, and like making funny noises on it, please have a look :)
